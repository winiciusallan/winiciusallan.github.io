I am a computer science undergraduate Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG) and an SRE at the Distributed Systems Laboratory (LSD), focusing on cloud computing, distributed systems, virtualization, and Linux technologies. 

I have hands-on experience with OpenStack and Kubernetes, where I've navigated the challenges of operating and automating cloud infrastructure effectively. 

My passion lies in contributing to open source. I've actively participated in community discussions and submitted patches to both upstream and downstream projects. Some of the projects I contribute to include:

* [Metal3](https://github.com/metal3-io)
* [Ironic](https://opendev.org/openstack/ironic)
* [Kolla-ansible](https://opendev.org/openstack/kolla-ansible)
* [Incus](https://github.com/lxc/incus)
